* Honestly, my number one policy is quality
* Never sell my soul is my philosophy
* High velocity, lyrics like Nostrodamus making prophecy
* Binary Star
* Come and ride away
* It's easier to stick to the earth
* Surrounded by the night
* Surrounded by the night
* And you don't go home
* The War on Drugs
